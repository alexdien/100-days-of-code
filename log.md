# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I started watching Alex Lee's YouTube tutorial on Hashmaps. I can solve Two Sum in LeetCode only by brute force O(N^2). I'm trying to solve it using a hashmap. I'm also reading the tech interview handbook and starting Leetcode Patterns by Sean Prashad. 

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
