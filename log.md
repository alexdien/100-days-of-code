# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I started watching Alex Lee's YouTube tutorial on Hashmaps. I can solve Two Sum in LeetCode only by brute force O(N^2). I'm trying to solve it using a hashmap. I'm also reading the tech interview handbook and starting Leetcode Patterns by Sean Prashad. 

**Thoughts** I can solve Two Sum on Leetcode now, which I couldn't even do in the past. I can tell I'm progressing.

### Day 2: August 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I began a course on fullstackopen.com. Hopefully I'm able to balance this out with regular school, but I will try to do atleast an hour a day of it. I also gathered resources and will begin NeetCode.io's 150.

**Thoughts** I wish I had more free time for self studying. Taking 15 credits this semester will make it hard to self study.

### Day 3: August 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I'm following the NeetCode 150. Today I struggled solving the Valid Anagrams LC #242, but after watching a few videos, I think I understand it now.

**Thoughts** I need to review arrays in Java. This syntax confused me the most in the solution: intArray[s.charAt(i)]++, but after much thinking I realized the array has a spot for each unique ASCII character and the computer knows to increment each different space. I will continue grinding LC!
