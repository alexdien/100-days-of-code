# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I started watching Alex Lee's YouTube tutorial on Hashmaps. I can solve Two Sum in LeetCode only by brute force O(N^2). I'm trying to solve it using a hashmap. I'm also reading the tech interview handbook and starting Leetcode Patterns by Sean Prashad. 

**Thoughts** I can solve Two Sum on Leetcode now, which I couldn't even do in the past. I can tell I'm progressing.

### Day 2: August 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I began a course on fullstackopen.com. Hopefully I'm able to balance this out with regular school, but I will try to do atleast an hour a day of it. I also gathered resources and will begin NeetCode.io's 150.

**Thoughts** I wish I had more free time for self studying. Taking 15 credits this semester will make it hard to self study.

### Day 3: August 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I'm following the NeetCode 150. Today I struggled solving the Valid Anagrams LC #242, but after watching a few videos, I think I understand it now.

**Thoughts** I need to review arrays in Java. This syntax confused me the most in the solution: intArray[s.charAt(i)]++, but after much thinking I realized the array has a spot for each unique ASCII character and the computer knows to increment each different space. I will continue grinding LC!

### Day 4: August 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I didn't code much since I am preparing for an interview on Wednesday. I will go over my projects and also try to practice some LC array questions.

**Thoughts** I'm nervous for this interview and not sure if it is technical or not. I'm preparing by reading Cracking the Coding Interview.

**Today's Progress**: I spent sometime learning about Python and Colab in one of my classes. I also prepared a bit more for my interview on Wednesday.

### Day 7: August 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I learned some new CLI commands in my Python class. I also figured out how to solve my interview coding question.

**Thoughts** I definitely didn't perform as well as I could, because I solved it in 5 minutes.

### Day 8: August 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about Two Pointers and attempted to solve Valid Palindrome.

**Thoughts** I'm starting to read Computational Thinking. I think this will be a good skill to have.
